    description: "As the Team Lead and Finalist in a competition with over 300+ teams, I spearheaded a drone data analytics project focused on revolutionizing agriculture through precision farming. Our team developed an innovative solution that integrates multiple sensors, including NDVI, NDRE, thermal, and multispectral, to capture real-time crop health data. We utilized AI-driven analytics to detect issues such as water stress, nutrient deficiencies, and disease, providing actionable insights for resource optimization. Our platform enables farmers to make data-driven decisions on irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, promoting sustainable and efficient farming practices.",

    title: "Technovista Hackathon",
    roles: ["ML Engineer"],
    description: "We developed a Plant Disease Detection System that leverages AI and deep learning to identify and classify up to 14 types of plant diseases from leaf images. By utilizing the VGG19 pretrained model and transfer learning, the system achieves accurate analysis, enabling early detection of diseases. This empowers farmers to take timely action, improving crop health and yield while reducing losses. The project seamlessly integrates image processing and machine learning techniques to provide an efficient and automated solution for disease detection, promoting sustainable farming practices. Additionally, the model is integrated into an AI chatbot, which not only identifies diseases but also provides information about their causes and actionable prevention strategies. All these features are presented through an intuitive, user-friendly website, offering farmers a comprehensive tool to manage plant health effectively.",

    description: "Our team was tasked with developing a Student-Alumni Relationship Platform to foster meaningful interactions between students and alumni of a specific college. The frontend development was managed by my team, while I took responsibility for the backend development. The platform serves as a hub for communication, collaboration, and opportunity sharing, enabling alumni to guide students with insights and experiences while offering a space for networking and mentorship. Although we didnâ€™t win the competition, we received special appreciation from the evaluator for successfully developing a fully functional, front-end and back-end integrated website within just 24 hours. This recognition highlighted our ability to collaborate effectively under pressure, deliver a complete solution within a tight deadline, and showcase technical proficiency in both frontend and backend development.",
